Sheikh Zayed, the Father of the Nation, once said that what he prized above all was not “material entities” but what he called “the able man”, possessed of “intellect and capabilities”. When he embarked on his quest to unite the territories that comprise today’s United Arab Emirates, the chief weapon in his arsenal was his vision. His legacy is indispensable to healing the fractures of a world that is being disfigured by demagoguery and divisive politics. He welcomed people from every part of the world with open arms, transforming the UAE into one of the most pluralistic societies in the world.

These are powerful mechanisms within the reach of any child in the Arab and Muslim worlds and therefore are to be regarded as a vital antidote to the manipulative and fundamentalist ideas devouring our youth.

''The diplomat and writer Omar Saif Ghobash visits us on the occasion of the Spanish publication of his book Letters to a Young Muslim (Picador, 2017), in which he reflects on the role of Islam today.


The book consists of a set of letters addressed to his older son in order to help him deal with questions regarding the situation of Islam in today’s world, while also confronting controversial issues and rebutting stereotypes. These texts by Omar Ghobash raise essential questions, for example how to avoid inculcating hate and to value difference, the role of social networks in the education of young people, and how religion might be a source of peaceful coexistence, dialogue, and social enrichment. His book is a contribution in the effort to keep young Muslims from extremism and violence and also aims to help any young person, whatever his or her religion, to understand and learn to identify and shun the underpinnings of hatred and xenophobia.

The letters have their origins in a fact that marked the life of Omar Ghobash, namely that his father was assassinated when he was only six years old. This meant that he grew up with the need to find answers to many questions. Now, aware that his son is also facing doubts about religion, society and the world, he has decided to accompany him along the way.

Omar Ghobash will be talking with Míriam Hatibi, an activist from Barcelona’s Muslim community and spokesperson for the Ibn Battuta Foundation, an entity that aims to offer social, cultural, educational, and employment support to immigrants from Arab countries, as well as to foster a peaceful coexistence and combat racism.

This activity, for which members of the public must register in advance, is addressed to school groups.''",Status,,,"11/15/2017 07:50:11 PM"," ",0,0

This is the message of profound syncretism, we can not love your religion if we do not remember that it was in this region that all the great monotheisms were born, including Islam. Born from a palimpsest of cultures and civilizations that make our religions inextricably linked, irreducible.
